# Overview

- This is a site for teaching basics of audio mixing, this is also my first milestone project for Code Institute's Fullstack Software Development course. The project was used to demonstrate the skills and knowledge of using HTML5 and CSS to create a static frontend website. 

- Many people write, record and producer their own music at home but don't know how to mix their elements to make their music sound good, Autonomix will have the beginner info to get them started. With my experience in the music industry as a mix engineer I felt this would be the perfect first step into software development, with it being something I'm both passionate about and that I wish I had when I began music production and audio mixing. 

# UX

The layout for Autonomix is simple, starting with a landing page with basic info about mixing as a concept followed by buttons that take the user directly to the topics they came to read about. Quick and easy. The learning pages will then contain a short body of text describing the concept of the technique, an explanation on how to use the technique and finally a video demonstration explaining the topic so that user's can hear and see it in use. 

## User Goals

Users are looking to:

- Learn to mix music with the basic techniques.
- See how see how the techniques are implemented by a professional.
- Contact the site with any additional questions.
- Use a site designed for any devive they could be viewing from.
- Easy to find social media links to follow Autonomix online.
