# Autonomix. 

Site for teaching basics of audio mixing.

Many people write, record and producer their own music at home but don't know how to mix their elements to make their music sound good, Autonomix will have the beginner info to get them started. 

# UX

The layout for Autonomix is simple, starting with a landing page with basic info about mixing as a concept followed by buttons that take the user directly to the topics they came to read about. Quick and easy.
