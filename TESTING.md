# Testing

To test the site, a sequence of steps were followed across various browsers and devices. The steps were as follow: 

 - Validate HTML and CSS using their respective validators.
 - All pages were checked to make sure that layout matched the [wireframes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ybowtp4rlgvrix/autonomix_wireframes.pdf?dl=0). 
 - All text was read through to be certain it was easy to read, understand and has no spelling or grammar errors.
 - Make sure that all images load in within a reasonable amount of time. 
 - Make sure correct page name is displayed in the tab (eg. Home | Autonomix.)

# User Stories 

The following are the steps I took to make sure the user stories listed in the [README.md](README.md/#UX) were fulfilled in the site:

*Numbers align with their respective User Story*

1. From the home page, I scroll down to the learn section (or hover over the learn nav link) and click on the topic I want to read about.
2. If I want to specifically learn about Balance, EQ or Compression I go to the previously mentioned learn sections and click on the specific topic I want. 
3. After reading about the topic I have clicked on, I can scroll to the bottom of the topic page and watch the linked video on the topic. 
4. To contact the site, I go to the navigation bar and click contact, fill out the form that appears on screen and hit submit. 
5. If I am on a tutorial page and decide I want to progress forward or back to a different topic, I can click the arrows at the bottom of the page to navigate to the desired page.
