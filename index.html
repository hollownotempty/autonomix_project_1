            So What Is Mixing?

                Mixing is the process of optimizing and blending recorded audio tracks into a final product, in this case your song. 
                This is done through the use of many techniques. On this site I will talk you through the big three, which are balancing (adjusting relative volumes), 
                equalizing (adjusting frequencies) and compression (reducing the loudest points of a sound).

                Use of these techniques works differently for different genres but the theory remains largely the same across all. 
                Mixing is generally done at quieter volumes before being sent to a mastering engineer to be prepared for distribution. 
                Mastering is a whole other beast to be tackled another time, for now letâ€™s get started with mixing!
