            What Is EQ?

                Ask any music producer what tool they use most, and nine-out-of-ten times they’re going to say EQ (short for equaliser). 
                In simple terms, EQ is a tool that allows you to turn down the level of individual sections of frequencies (or ‘frequency bands’) in a signal. 
                It is used to pull out harsh frequencies or push up ones we like, allowing us to change the sonic character of a sound graphically.

        <h2>How to use it.</h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to setting your EQ up, there will be three settings to look at. These are your <strong>gain</strong>, <strong>cut-off</strong> and <strong>bandwidth (or Q)</strong>. 
            <br>
            <strong>Gain</strong> controls the amplitude of the frequency you are affecting, this can be a boost or a cut. 
            Your <strong>cut-off</strong> is the point in the frequency spectrum at which a filter or EQ is applied. Your <strong>Q</strong> decides how broad your boost or cut is, with higher values being narrower towards your cut-off. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Your filter type will decide the type of equaliser you will be using, common filter types include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Low cut - Cuts everything below the cut-off</li>
            <li>High cut - Cuts everything above the cut-off</li>
            <li>Bell -  Boost or cut the chosen part of the frequency spectrum</li>
            <li>High Shelf - Cut or boost all frequencies above the cut-off</li>
            <li>Low Shelf - Cut or boost all frequencies below the cut-off</li>
        </ul>
